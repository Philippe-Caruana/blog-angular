This project aims to learn the basics of Angular through a small exercise to understand the basics of the framework. It corresponds to the second activity of the OpenClassrooms Angular course.

Firstly you must have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and [Angular CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli) in a global way to be able to initialize the project.
